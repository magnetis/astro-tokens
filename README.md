## Introduction

**Astro Tokens** is package of default tokens used in Astro Native and used in projects based on Astro to make easier the development and standardize the design system.

Astro is created by designers, developers, product managers, data analysts, data scientists, stakeholders and enthusiasts, which helps us protect the brand concepts, elevate consistency of user experience and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products for our customers.
