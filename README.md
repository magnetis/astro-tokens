## Introduction

**Astro Tokens** is package of default tokens used in Astro Native and used in projects based on Astro to make easier the development and standardize the design system.

Astro is created by designers, developers, product managers, data analysts, data scientists, stakeholders and enthusiasts, which helps us protect the brand concepts, elevate consistency of user experience and increase the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products for our customers.

## Committing

We recommend you to use `yarn cz` when committing. That way, you'll be presented an interactive prompt to build out commit message. But don't worry, if you prefer to commit in any other way, our project uses CommitLint to make sure patterns are being followed.
